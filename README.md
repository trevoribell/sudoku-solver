# sudoku-solver
For solving sudoku puzzles.

A simple implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve a constraint satisfaction problem (a sudoku puzzle). I wanted to learn more about this approach to solving constraint satisfaction problems as they appear a lot in real-life engineering problems and backtracking has been shown to be effective in coming to a solution (albeit a much more comprehensive implementation than what is done here, but the principles remain).

It was first written in Python and then transferred to Javascript such that a better front-end could be made.
